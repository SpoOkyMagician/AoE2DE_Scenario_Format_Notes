# AoE2DE_Scenario_Format_Notes
This is my notes on the scenario format of 1.51... I am really getting frustrated working on this so, I am going to upload my current notes. I dunno if I will finish these but, this will hopefully explain it a bit more to you.

Note: Most of my information comes from the scenario parser of course. (Thanks a lot KSneijders.)
