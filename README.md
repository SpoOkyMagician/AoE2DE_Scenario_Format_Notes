# AoE2DE_Scenario_Format_Notes
This is my notes on the scenario format of 1.51... I am really getting frustrated working on this so, I am going to upload my current notes. I dunno if I will finish these but, this will hopefully explain it a bit more to you.

Note: Most of my information comes from the scenario parser of course. (Thanks a lot KSneijders.)

https://github.com/KSneijders/AoE2ScenarioParser/blob/542f07414551eb2c15c7a8cbb7f7618b2ca4cab5/AoE2ScenarioParser/versions/DE/v1.51/structure.json

Note: I was comparing a scenario I made in game ("_ALL_SCENARIO_STUFF_OBJECTS") to the actual results. (I wanted to be sure exactly what was happening to the file/bytes directly.)

Progress: I am currently at disabled techs and I am considering giving up at this point. There is WAY TOO MUCH DATA to handle here... (I am sure I could finish it eventually but, ugh...) Note: I left off at: 0000AC80 on "53 00 00 00".

Personal Note: Honestly, there is way too much redundant/useless data in this file... (They really need to re-format this damn thing...)
